Schier
======

**Schier** is a learning project written in HTML/JS/CSS. It visualises the current tide at the West-Frisian island of [Schiermonnikoog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schiermonnikoog), and adjusts opacity according to sunrise/sunset at the same location (i.e., it gets dark at night). It taught me a lot about JSON.

This project is very much unfinished.
